1,Alabama,131,"The eastern indigo snake is the longest snake native to the United States. Dry, sandy oak and pine forests are important for this species and Defenders is working across the country to protect both federal and private lands that are home to these snakes. "
2,Alaska,9,"Polar bears are the largest living carnivores on Earth. Their survival is threatened by loss of habitat and sea ice from human disturbance and climate change. Defenders is currently working to save important denning habitat for the Southern Beaufort Sea population, found in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, from oil drilling."
3,Arizona,64,The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas. Their numbers are declining because of habitat destruction and trophy hunting. Defenders played a key role in establishing the Northern Jaguar Reserve in Mexico and continues to work to protect this species from human conflict along the U.S. - Mexico border.
4,Arkansas,36,"Sometimes known as the ""snot otter,"" the hellbender is North America's largest salamander. Ore and gravel mining have lowered the water quality in their river habitats. Defenders launched the Southeastern Hellbender Conservation Initiative (SEHCI) working with private landowners for habitat restoration."
5,California,296,"The last 27 free-flying condors were taken into captivity in 1987. Condors were reintroduced into the wild in 1991, and their population has now grown to over 300. Defenders has worked with the California legislature to phase out lead ammunition to reduce lead poisoning - the number one cause of death in condors."
6,Colorado,34,Gunnison sage grouse males try to attract a mate by fluttering their wings and creating popping sounds from two air sacs on their chest. This grouse has become one of the most endangered birds in North America as a result of habitat loss and degradation. Defenders was heavily engaged in the National Sage Grouse Planning Strategy and other initiatives to ensure the protection of this grouse and the sagebrush habitat it depends on.
7,Connecticut,12,"Found in northeastern North America, roseate terns tend to nest in colonies with the more aggressive common tern, providing them protection from predators. Roseate tern researchers often need to wear head protection due to the common terns’ aggression. Their numbers have decreased in some regions due to increased competition and predation by gulls."
8,Delaware,11,"Each year the red knot travels more than 9,000 miles from breeding to wintering grounds - that's over 3 coast-to-coast U.S. road trips! In the past decade, the population has dropped 80%. Defenders was part of the successful fight to list the species under the ESA. "
9,District of Columbia,2,"This aquatic crustacean resembles a very tiny shrimp – about the size of your little fingernail!  But this doesn't make the amphipod any less important. As the only federally endangered species that lives exclusively in Washington D.C., it is an important indicator about the health of local creeks. "
10,Florida,134,"The panther is recognized as Florida's official state animal and as one of the most endangered mammals in the country. Defenders lobbied for the panther's listing almost 50 years ago and now continues to fight to protect large, interconnected tracts of wild land for their survival. "
11,Georgia,76,"The red-cockaded woodpecker is the only woodpecker to create hollows in living pine trees, taking up to two years to dig a single home. Logging decimated their population, but their numbers have slowly improved since listing in 1973. Defenders is fighting Trump administration attempts to reduce or eliminate protections for the species."
